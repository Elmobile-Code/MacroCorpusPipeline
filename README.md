# MacroCorpus pipeline

Downloads every survey from the official [BLS LABSTAT](https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/) flat files and writes one JSON file per series. The public BLS API is not required.

The repository does not contain downloaded surveys. `python run.py` creates `data/` on your machine.

## 1. What you need

- Python 3.11 or newer (`python3 --version`).
- Git.
- A network connection to `download.bls.gov`. The program sends a descriptive User-Agent. A bare download client is rejected.

On macOS the system `python3` is sometimes older than 3.11. Install a newer Python first.

The full LABSTAT tree is large: tens of catalogs, some with multi-hundred-megabyte history files, and a few (such as fatal injuries) with hundreds of thousands of series files.

## 2. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shah-darshit/MacroCorpusPipeline.git
cd MacroCorpusPipeline
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

On Windows PowerShell, activate with `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`.

Leave the virtualenv active. In a new terminal, run `source .venv/bin/activate` again from the project folder.

## 3. Download every catalog

```bash
python run.py
```

That is the only command a new user needs. It lists the LABSTAT root, then for each two-letter survey folder downloads the files, joins code names, and writes the series files. One catalog failing is recorded and the next catalog still runs. A later `python run.py` skips a catalog whose remote listing has not changed. Pass `--force` to rebuild anyway.

`--only WS,CU` is for tests and debugging. It is not required to process a catalog.

When it finishes, look here:

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `data/run.json` | Which prefixes were found, which finished, which failed |
| `data/cu/raw/` | Original BLS files for that catalog |
| `data/cu/catalog.json` | Joins, coverage, file checksums, listing fingerprint |
| `data/cu/index.json` | `series_id` → file path, title, observation count |
| `data/cu/series/CUSR0000SA0.json` | One series: codes, names, and the full history of values |

Each series file looks like this:

```json
{
  "series_id": "CUSR0000SA0",
  "area_code": "0000",
  "area_name": "U.S. city average",
  "item_code": "SA0",
  "item_name": "All items",
  "series_title": "All items in U.S. city average...",
  "observations": [
    {"year": "1997", "period": "M01", "value": "159.40", "footnote_codes": ""}
  ]
}
```

There is no snapshot id in the path or in the series body. A rerun overwrites `data/<prefix>/`.

## 4. Tests

No download and no API key:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

The tests use a small saved slice of the BD files in `tests/fixtures/bd/` and mocked HTTP.

## How a survey is read

The pipeline reads the header row of each file. A complete data file (`AllItems`, `AllData`, or `AllCESSeries`) is preferred over a `Current` file when both contain the same series, year, and period. Codes stay text. Seasonal status and frequency come from the catalog and the name tables, not from the series title. Folders that are not surveys (`compressed`, `sdmx`, `esbr`) and prefixes with no LABSTAT directory (`PF`, `PI`, `LF`) are skipped.
